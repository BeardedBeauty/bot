LIRI is a basic text assistant kind of like Siri, but there are only four different kinds of commands, and it's on a commandline run by javascript and node.

## Usage
LIRI takes in four commands with the fourth (and onward) arguments as the variable. Syntax:
```
node liri <command-here> <variables here, spaces acceptable>
```

Example:
```
node liri concert-this Trampled by Turtles
```

### concert-this
Searches for upcoming concerts with the band/group provided
### spotify-this-song
Searches for a matching song name with the info provided
### movie-this
Searches for info about a movie with the name provided
### do-what-it-says
• This command takes in no other arguments
• Reads from Random.txt and takes in the command written in that file. (One of the other three commands)
